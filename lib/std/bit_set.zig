//! This file defines several variants of bit sets.  A bit set
//! is a densely stored set of integers with a known maximum,
//! in which each integer gets a single bit.  Bit sets have very
//! fast presence checks, update operations, and union and intersection
//! operations.  However, if the number of possible items is very
//! large and the number of actual items in a given set is usually
//! small, they may be less memory efficient than an array set.
//!
//! There are five variants defined here:
//!
//! IntegerBitSet:
//!   A bit set with static size, which is backed by a single integer.
//!   This set is good for sets with a small size, but may generate
//!   inefficient code for larger sets, especially in debug mode.
