/* atan2(y,x)
 * Method :
 *      1. Reduce y to positive by atan2(y,x)=-atan2(-y,x).
 *      2. Reduce x to positive by (if x and y are unexceptional):
 *              ARG (x+iy) = arctan(y/x)           ... if x > 0,
 *              ARG (x+iy) = pi - arctan[y/(-x)]   ... if x < 0,
 *
 * Special cases:
 *
 *      ATAN2((anything), NaN ) is NaN;
 *      ATAN2(NAN , (anything) ) is NaN;
 *      ATAN2(+-0, +(anything but NaN)) is +-0  ;
 *      ATAN2(+-0, -(anything but NaN)) is +-pi ;
 *      ATAN2(+-(anything but 0 and NaN), 0) is +-pi/2;
 *      ATAN2(+-(anything but INF and NaN), +INF) is +-0 ;
 *      ATAN2(+-(anything but INF and NaN), -INF) is +-pi;
 *      ATAN2(+-INF,+INF ) is +-pi/4 ;
 *      ATAN2(+-INF,-INF ) is +-3pi/4;
 *      ATAN2(+-INF, (anything but,0,NaN, and INF)) is +-pi/2;
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following
 * constants. The dec
